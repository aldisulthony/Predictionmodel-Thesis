# PredictionModel-Thesis
The proposed global workflow system is started from retrieving data stage with IoT mechanism, stores data in MySQL database, and develops the bok choy, also known as pak choi, prediction model.

There are six phases is discussed in this project, as follows:
1. Data Mining
2. Data Preparation
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Model Tuning
6. Prediction Model Testing

The dataset contains continuous and categorical attributes also the desired class as the label in the class column for the target output variable. The machine learning technique used is supervised learning, detailed by the classification approach based on the dataset's content.

The stored sensed data of each plant based on the irrigation system from the database, as the data mining phase, resulting in the automatic and manual irrigation system dataset. Data Preparation to Model Evaluation phase is conducted in the Training Model Python Notebook and Prediction Model Testing is performed in the Testing Model Python Notebook detailed by every markdown to mention the purpose of each command.

The phase of Model Tuning is not implemented, as it used for the undergraduate analysis, because the project's objective to create the dataset based on the proposed system and execute machine learning technique to analyze the dataset ready to perform the suitable algorithm, namely decision tree.

The result is satisfied as it resulting to 100% for Accuracy Score and classification report strengthen by the confusion matrix is classified the avaialable 319 instances for the Less Optimal and Optimal label. The confusion matrix refers to the perfect classifier case. The absence of the Not Optimal is because there are not enough instances available in the dataset.

The thesis book that discuss this project will be available soon in the Telkom University Open Library repository entitled entitled of "Bok Choy Growth Prediction Model Analysis Based On Smart Farm Using Machine Learning". 

If already available, this note will be edited soon.
